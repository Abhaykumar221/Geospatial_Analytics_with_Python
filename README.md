# Geospatial_Analytics_with_python
1. Geospatial data science as a discipline combines statistical analysis, computational geometry, image processing, and machine learning.
2. Some of the most important fields in which geospatial data science is employed today include urban planning, natural resource management, epidemiology, agriculture, telecommunications, and environmental risk management.
3.  Geospatial data, also known simply as spatial data or sometimes geographic data/information, is any data that is spatially referenced. This means that each data point references a specific location or space.
4. Data Types
       There are two main types of data:
        feature, or vector, data    
        coverage, or raster, data
1. Feature (vector) data are digital representations of the real world, such as roads, lakes, trees, and buildings. These features can be represented as points, lines, or polygons–each having its associated attributes. 
2. In contrast, coverage (raster) data is a continuous surface of data values across space. They are usually represented as grids with a given cell or pixel size, each cell in the grid having a data value. Some examples of raster data include aerial photographs and satellite images.
3. This involves the use of coordinate reference systems (CRS), or spatial reference systems. Without CRS, we would not know the exact location of our spatial data.
4. There are two main types of CRS: projected (also called Cartesian or rectangular) CRS and geographic CRS
5. Geographic CRS, in particular the WGS84/EPSG:4326, are very commonly used for mapping. Locations on the Earth’s surface are defined by their latitude and longitude (sometimes also by their altitude), telling you exactly where they lie. Geographic CRS are global coordinate systems that cover the whole globe.


# We have used data taken from (https://geodacenter.github.io/)
1. The [Chicago health and socioeconomic statistics](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/comarea_vars/) dataset covers public health and socio-economic indicators for the 77 community areas (i.e. neighbourhoods) of Chicago in 2014. 
2. The [Chicago supermarkets](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/chicago_sup_vars/) data shows all grocery stores across Chicago in 2015 (scraped from Google Maps).
These two data sets are used in file 2 (i.e. Manipulation2.ipynb).
# For third file (i.e. Visualisation3.ipynb)
 we have taken data from these resources.
1. [Building footprints ](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Buildings/Building-Footprints-current-/hz9b-7nh8)https://data.cityofchicago.org/Buildings/Building-Footprints-current-/hz9b-7nh8
2. [Major streets](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Major-Streets/ueqs-5wr6)https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Major-Streets/ueqs-5wr6
3. [Parks](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Parks-Recreation/Parks-Chicago-Park-District-Park-Boundaries-curren/ej32-qgdr)https://data.cityofchicago.org/Parks-Recreation/Parks-Chicago-Park-District-Park-Boundaries-curren/ej32-qgdr


# Also you can also download data from the given [Gdrive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QyEHTEbO76-uDHs0z_7_F4II-BuZ9-8n?usp=sharing)
1. Chicago data is used in Manipulation2,
2. Chicago data2 is used in Visualisation3.
